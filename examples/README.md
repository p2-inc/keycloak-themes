# CSS theme examples

These are themes implemented as CSS only. While they can be used as the basis of a packaged theme, they are meant to be used with the [Phase Two](https://phasetwo.io/) theme extensions.

Read the [blog post](https://phasetwo.io/blog/customizing-login-pages) for more information on how to use them with Phase Two enhanced Keycloak.
